/**
 * DBID is a fixed-length identifier for nodes on a ringspace.  Since
 * it is fixed length, the length needs to be as long as the longest
 * allowable key size so that the ID space contains the granularity to
 * load balance data.  This length is defined as DBID_LENGTH below.
 *
 * In other words: DBID_LENGTH is the maximum key length for any query.
 *
 * Comparisons of short keys will pad the incoming key with 0s to
 * meet this size when necessary.  You can redefine DBID_LENGTH to
 * whatever size you desire, but DBID comparisons will take time
 * proportional to the size.
